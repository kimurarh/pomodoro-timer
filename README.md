## What is the Pomodoro Technique
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method which centers around timing your focus/work intervals and breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro. The length of focus and break times can vary depending on your preference, but the "traditional" method is:

1) Work for 25 minutes (pomodoro)
2) Take a 5-minute break
3) After every four pomodoros, take a longer break (20 minutes)

The benefits of the Pomodoro Technique come from the frequent breaks, which help your mind stay fresh.
